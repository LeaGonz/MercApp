# My React + Vite + Tailwind Project

## 📌 MercApp - Project Progress Log

### Day 1 – Setup & Internationalization (i18n) Basics

Today I started the foundation of my project.

- ✅ Created the repository and set up React with Vite.
- ✅ Installed and configured TailwindCSS for styling.
- ✅ Added i18n (internationalization) support with language JSON files.
- ✅ Implemented manual language switching between Portuguese, Spanish and English.

### 🔍 What I Learned

- How Vite works as a modern, fast bundler for React projects.
- The basics of TailwindCSS and how utility classes style the UI.
- How i18n manages translations and how to switch languages with `useTranslation` and `changeLanguage`.

### 🚀 Next Steps

- Add **automatic browser language detection**.
- Continue building the app step by step with clean code and documentation.

I’m building this project while learning, so everything is documented as clearly as possible.  
This repository is not just about code – it’s about growth, discipline, and continuous improvement 🌱.
