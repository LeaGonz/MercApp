# My React + Vite + Tailwind Project

## ðŸ“Œ MercApp - Project Progress Log

### Day 1 â€“ Setup & Internationalization (i18n) Basics

Today I started the foundation of my project.

- âœ… Created the repository and set up React with Vite.
- âœ… Installed and configured TailwindCSS for styling.
- âœ… Added i18n (internationalization) support with language JSON files.
- âœ… Implemented manual language switching between Portuguese, Spanish and English.

### Day 2 â€“ Browser Language Detection + Basic Routing
- âœ… Installed and configured `i18next-browser-languagedetector`.
- âœ… Detection order set to **localStorage â†’ navigator**, and the chosen language is cached in localStorage. (Common pitfall fixed: the option is spelled `"navigator"`.)
- âœ… Created basic routing with React Router v6:
  - `/` â†’ Home
  - `/about` â†’ About
  - `/contact` â†’ Contact
  - `*` â†’ NotFound (fallback)
- âœ… Verified translations render via `t("key")` across pages.

**Next Steps**
- Build a shared **Layout** with `<Outlet />`, a **Navbar** (with language selector), and **Footer**.
- Add `public/data/products.json` as the seed catalog.
- Implement the cart MVP:
  - Add items with quantity control.
  - Show item subtotals, total sum, and item count.
  - Edit/remove actions.
  - Persist to `localStorage` under `mercapp_cart_v1`.
- Add a bottom sticky bar with the running total and an over-budget alert.

Iâ€™m building this project while learning, so everything is documented as clearly as possible.  
This repository is not just about code â€“ itâ€™s about growth, discipline, and continuous improvement ðŸŒ±.
